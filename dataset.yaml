# Class descriptions (for reference)
# barely-riped: Beans just starting to ripen, mostly green with slight color change
# over-riped:   Beans past optimal ripeness, dark/brown color
# riped:        Fully ripe beans, optimal for harvesting (red/cherry color)
# semi-riped:   Partially ripe, yellow-orange color
# unriped:      Completely unripe, green beans
